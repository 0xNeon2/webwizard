### Methodology:
The creation of WebWizard adhered to a well-defined methodology, ensuring a systematic and effective development process:

•	**Exploration:** In the initial phase, an in-depth exploration of existing web testing tools and their command-line interface (CLI) requirements was carried out. This provided crucial insights into the functionalities and capabilities that were integrated into WebWizard.

•	**Blueprint:** Following the exploration phase, a comprehensive system architecture blueprint was crafted. This blueprint laid the foundation for a robust and streamlined system, optimizing the management and integration of various tools.

•	**Construction:** With the blueprint in place, the development phase commenced. This stage involved the actual implementation of the command-line interface, integration of the some tools, and the incorporation of desired features.

•	**Validation:** Extensive testing was conducted to validate the application's performance, security, and usability. Rigorous testing helped identify and rectify any issues, ensuring that WebWizard operates reliably.

This methodology ensured that every aspect of WebWizard's development was thoroughly planned and executed.
